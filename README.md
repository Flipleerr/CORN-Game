# CORN-Game
A GitHub repository for the indie game CORN.

CORN is an indie game created by @TheFlipleerr and @ICHORSHYSTERIA on Twitter.
It is designed to mimic olden age PSX games in terms of style, and is made to be simple.
Due to certain circumstances, the game will be ported to Python using the FPPE (Flexible Python Platformer Engine).

Follow @CORNGame on Twitter for updates.

# Contributions
Any and all contributions are appreciated.

Since the game runs on **pygame**, all contributions to the source code itself must be saved in the .py format.
Export textures in .png, _especially_ for UI assets and transparency.
Sound effects/music must be provided in the .ogg format in order to conserve space.

It is highly recommended to submit all contributions to a seperate branch, because said branch might fall behind the current development version very quickly.
