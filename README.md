Any and all contributions are appreciated.

Since the game runs on **Unity**, it is reccomended to have any code written be in **C#**.
Blender is used for modeling, although no one cares about .blend files so just export them as **.fbx**.
Export textures in **.png**, **_especially_ for UI assets** and transparency.
